            </h3>

            <span>
                3.1 When you analyse a game on the Website, we collect any information that you
                have explicitly provided to us. This includes the PGN (Portable Game Notation)
                file that represents the game that you have chosen to analyse. Depending on the
                PGN file provided, this may include:

                <ul>
                    <li>Player names and ratings</li>
                    <li>Tournament and event information</li>
                    <li>Time control, variant, results and other game metadata</li>
                </ul>

                3.2 We collect PGN files in order to process your analysis request.
                We may sometimes retain PGN files provided for game analysis for longer periods
                of time in order to improve the Website and aid the development of new services.
                If PGN files are retained for this reason, they will be anonymised.
